Hello
-----

A while ago, I created this project, to link opencv's java wrapper easily to my maven projects. While I was working on it, I realized that this task is already done perfectly by [Bytedco](https://github.com/bytedeco) in a very higher level. So I deleted the repository started to use their work in my own project. But it's not possible to delete the maven repository and the package is still there. So I re-created the repository to put this note and point to the existing solution. I hope it halped. 


Regards.

Mani
